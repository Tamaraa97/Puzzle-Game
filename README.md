# Puzzle-Game
The home page of the game is in the document "new"
At the top of the page is a "top" menu with buttons that represents the section of the page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents.
By clicking on each button, you go to the html page of the same name with the appropriate content. All buttons are the same size. With them we can open the registration form, find out the rules of the game, etc ..
Puzzle is a game with letters. The game starts by clicking the start button. When the start button is pressed, the time starts counting down. Time is limited to 90 seconds. 
When the time expires, a message appears: your time has expired. When the time expires, the interval is cleared and returned to the initial value.
If the time expires before we click the end button, the computer takes the word that is currently composed. After that, a pop-up appears first with the message, "Your time is up", and then after you press the "Confirm" button, a new pop-up will be displayed in with the word that was entered at the time expired times. 
To play the game again, after this we need to turn off the existing window, and then open the .html document from the beginning.
The computer offers 12 randomly selected letters and by permuting the letter one should get as long a word as possible. Each letter used in the word brings 3 points.
Word entry is allowed in all forms (cases, plural, verb tenses).

HOW TO PLAY?
12 letters will be displayed from which the word should be composed. Use the left mouse button to select the letters you want add to word.
Use the DELETE option to remove the last selected letter. Also, since each added letter brings 3 points, the number of points won will be displayed after hovering the mouse over the "DELETE" button. If we put together a word of 5 letters, then the number of points is 15.
The word can be typed using the keyboard. It is not possible to use the copy / paste option. When you have entered the word click on the end option.
The time is limited to 90 seconds, and the countdown begins when you click the start button. In case the time expires, the computer takes the word you currently have composed.
